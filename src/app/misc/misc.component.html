  <p>
    <span class="font-italic">
      Late one dark and stormy night, there was a shadow on the wall.<br/>
      The Blue Tarantula was ready to strike again.<br/>
      Who will be his next victim?<br/>
      Will it be YOU?<br/>
      Or will it be the little bunny next door?<br/>
      Only the Blue Tarantula knows for sure.<br/>
      ...<br/>
<!--      *this middle part I made up*<br/>-->
<!--      The Blue Tarantula knew that earlier that day, a bunny named Ryne saw a spider on the floor and stepped on it.<br/>-->
<!--      To avenge that spider's horrible end, the Blue Tarantula was at Ryne's house that night.<br/>-->
<!--      While Ryne was fast asleep, the Blue Tarantula removed him from his bed and...SQUISH!<br/>-->
<!--      Ryne met the same grotesque fate as the spider he stepped on that day.<br/>-->
<!--      *back to the original story*-->
      So, the next time you squish a bug, WATCH OUT! The Blue Tarantula might just squish you!<br/>
