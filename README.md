# Max & Ruby: Front-end

This project is the front-end UI of my Max & Ruby full-stack fan app. The stack used for this app includes Angular for the front-end, Spring
for the back-end, and MySQL for the database of characters and episodes. My app will only focus on the characters and episodes in Seasons 1-5
of the series because in those episodes, Max only says a word or two for each time he speaks.

Max & Ruby characters and concept originally created by Rosemary Wells. The Max & Ruby cartoon series, based on the books by Wells, was
originally produced by Nelvana Ltd. in Canada in 2002-2019 and aired in the U.S. on Nick Jr.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.4.
